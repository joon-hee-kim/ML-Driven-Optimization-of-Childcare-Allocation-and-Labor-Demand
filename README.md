# ML-Driven Optimization of Childcare Allocation and Labor Demand 
This is the result of a project that utilized and applied public data related to daycare centers and labor (recruitment, job search) to machine learning algorithms.    

This result was also applied to the "2024 National Happiness Service Discovery and Entrepreneurship Contest" hosted by the Korea Social Security Information Service and was selected as the final entry.

## Motivation
In a situation where orphanage leavers and those requiring guardians continue to experience economic difficulties, and in South Korea, where labor shortages are worsening as we enter a super-aging society, the introduction of a job matching system for orphanage leavers is an urgent task.

- 4. Analysis and visualization </br>
By looking at the visualized data, you can see which regions have a low labor demand ratio. Therefore, population should be allocated to these regions first.
